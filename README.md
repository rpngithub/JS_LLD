Low level design practice with JS

##Debouncing
Debouncing is a technique that **delays the execution of a function** until the user stops performing a certain action for a specified amount of time.
In debouncing, the function is only executed after a specific delay since the last event's occurrence.

##Throttling
Throttling is a technique that **limits the execution of a function** to once in every specified time interval. 
In throttling, the function is executed at a fixed interval. Even if the triggering event occurs more frequently, the function is invoked according to the defined interval.
